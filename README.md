# ECE 4180 Final Project

**Brief Project Description**

In this project, our team created a bluetooth-controlled robot. The robot can be controlled on a Flask website that is created when running the code. The robot will be controlled via a Bluetooth GUI interface with a live-camera feed streamed to a laptop where the user can control the movement of the robot. In addition, there is an autonomous, line-following functionality. After the robot has navigated to a line, on the push of a button on the webpage, the robot will autonomously follow the line using 2 IR sensors. LED's were used to alert when a line has been succesfully detected. A crash detection system was also implemented using sonors when the robot gets too close to an object, a sound on the speaker will be played to alert the user.
